# Underscore Chrome Omnibox Extension
---------
This is just a simple chrome extension to add underscore documentation to Chrome's Omnibox. This allows you to view information about Underscore's methods quickly, through Chrome's search bar, without ever opening up the Underscore page itself.

## How To
--------
Once installed, all you need to do is hit `_` and then `enter` or `tab` while focused on the Omnibox (search bar) in Chrome. That will place you into the extension context, where you can start searching the underscore docs. Hitting enter on any search entry will open up the Underscore docs page.
